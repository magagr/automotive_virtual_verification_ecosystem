\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} development of automotive control architectures is increasingly dependent on the use of modeling and simulation technologies.
% Use cases include the development of control algorithms and their related software implementations,
% of “platform” hardware/software architectures
% %(e.g., OEM ECU HW design \& integration, SW IP qualification and integration, LLHWIO SW development, etc.),
% and calibrations at the vehicle, subsystem, and hardware/software component level.
Unfortunately, the history of automotive OEMs (original equipment
manufacturers) as large systems integrators of pre-allocated functionality to ECU (electronic control unit) hardware,
often results in modeling and simulation technologies being deployed %(reactively)
late in the development process,
% %(e.g., at the HW/SW/Plant integration stage)
and customized to specific use cases, domains, and/or organizations.
There is a lack of standardized processes for tool/model integration and management across the OEMs' engineering organizations. 
% The primary consequence of these problems is the OEM's struggle to design systems of ever-increasing complexity due to the growing number of errors,
% that often originate early in the conceptual and preliminary design phases, but aren't discovered until later during the hardware/software integration phase.
% Furthermore, the development speed of hardware and software components
% %(e.g., microcontrollers and software components)
% are limited by the supplier's own hardware and software development cycles.
% Thus, the integration of software and hardware can only be tested very late in the development cycle,
% further contributing to the possibility of costly software bugs and design errors.
% This leads to increased production delays and costly vehicle recalls, that significantly reduce product quality and profit margins.
% Finally, using component models and corresponding analysis and simulation tools to support the early verification and integration of control systems has not yet been widely accepted by OEMs
% -- or the automotive design community in general --
% as part of a standard development process.
% Currently, standard development processes are driven primarily by the exchange of tangible assets (ECUs, microcontrollers) and software IPs
% %(e.g., low lever device drivers),
% and not models of it, therefore preventing any opportunity of early integration.
Understanding the underlying ecosystem of cross-organizational collaborations will allow us to properly articulate the benefits, impediments, and enablers of designing electrical control architectures using shared modelling and virtual verification methodologies.

%\subsection{Availability of models vs. availability of hardware}
Virtual verification based on shared models is a strategy to manage the cone of uncertainty \cite{Boehm1981}, 
which says that uncertainty is gradually reduced as development progresses,
more information about the system becomes available,
and system integration aspects can be tested.
Many decisions need to be made in the beginning of the development process, though, when uncertainty is greatest.
Thus, the ability to give early feedback about design decisions is an important asset.
Consequently, any model characterizing hardware performance before the actual silicon hardware exists can be valuable in helping to develop the embedded software earlier.
%Once the hardware exists, models need to depict the hardware as closely as possible.
%A lack of accuracy is then hard to compensate by additional value of models over the real hardware, such as easy, location independent availability and scalability.

% Several R\&D and engineering teams,
% at a large North American OEM,
% have been addressing the organizational and technical challenges related to the mainstream adoption of modeling and simulation technologies, for the virtual development and integration of electrical control architectures, to reduce the risk of late design changes.
% The main area of progress has been the adoption of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) benches,
% coupling real time models of plants and of the rest-of-the-vehicle serial data traffic with real loads, sensors, and controllers.
% Other areas of progress include software-in-the-loop (SIL) technologies, used to simulate the control behavior coupled with simpler real time models of plants.
% Finally, high fidelity models of microprocessors running the real target controller code have been investigated.
% While HIL benches are a mature area at the OEM, other areas exhibit technical and organizational challenges of various nature.
%In this article, we discuss some of the benefits, challenges, and enablers of modeling and simulation technologies for electrical control architecture,
%by analyzing the high fidelity modeling and simulation of processor technologies.
%We then generalize our findings to the more general area of modeling and simulation technologies for virtual development and integration.
%We believe that the work described in this article is of significance to any one
%at the OEM
%who is facing challenges, trying to "cross the chasm" from early niche adoption to main stream.
%By analyzing benefits, enablers, and impediments to adoption by means of interviews and workshops with relevant stakeholders in the ecosystem, we are able to identify potential ways to overcome the resistance to change, or at least possible ways to sell the value proposition.

%Model-based systems engineering aims to capture this information within a model that is managed throughout the product lifecycle. It is promising to extend these system models with relevant models on lower abstraction levels such as Microprocessor models that describe how ECUs are implemented. If connected, they would provide a bottom-up model for systems engineering, covering the automotive value chain (i.e. the process and activities that add value to an automotive system across OEM and suppliers), and allowing to reason about system aspects in a holistic way.

%we provide an overview of the technology area of focus.
The research presented in this paper is based on semi-structured interviews
