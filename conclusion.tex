The focus of this paper is 
the ecosystem for model sharing and virtual verification for automotive software development.
As the emerging ecosystem is still in its early stage,
we share a map of impediments and enablers we found most useful to plan the activities needed to achieve the technical and collaborative benefits.
Specifically, we recommend to:
%Actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a pilot use case to clarify model fidelity needs.
    \item Define the anticipated value from solving the pilot use case.
    \item Bootstrap the ecosystem by sharing knowledge and clarifying the actor--role mapping \cite{kilamo2012proprietary} .
\end{itemize}

Our findings indicate that virtual verification is a promising approach that could improve automotive software development across organizational boundaries.



%We aim at understanding benefits, impediments, and enablers of modeling and simulation technologies based upon a scenario we analyze in detail and then generalize the findings of. Throughout the report, and based upon the interviews and the workshop we have hosted, we conclude that:
% Such ecosystems
% for models and simulation technologies
% may play a major role both in impeding and enabling their large scale adoption in development processes.

%Modeling and Simulation technical advantages and business benefits may not be considered sufficient to justify their deployment as OEM organizational challenges may prevent it (e.g., lack of HRs).

% Finally, we believe that overcoming these impediments will play a key role in increasing the competitive advantage of the OEM in the market place, as it will allow the OEM to reduce control system development lead time and costs (pre- and post-sales).

%We find that a systematic, model-based approach could enforce good system engineering practices throughout the ecosystem, and offer a holistic view on value creating engineering activities. If further confirmed, these results could support establishing an integrated model-based engineering approach at the whole vehicle level. While our research focusses on accelerating software development - we see this as one important sub-use cases and a step towards supporting a complete model-based approach that would allow to capture all relevant information in a (federated) system engineering model (e.g. SysML) and link it to engineering analysis and implementation downstream tools.
