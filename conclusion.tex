The focus of this article is the study of ecosystems for control architecture models and simulation technologies.
%We aim at understanding benefits, impediments, and enablers of modeling and simulation technologies based upon a scenario we analyze in detail and then generalize the findings of. Throughout the report, and based upon the interviews and the workshop we have hosted, we conclude that:
Such ecosystems
%for models and simulation technologies
may play a major role both in impeding and enabling their large scale adoption in development processes.

Modeling and Simulation technical advantages and business benefits may not be considered sufficient to justify their deployment as OEM organizational challenges may prevent it (e.g., lack of HRs).

% Finally, we believe that overcoming these impediments will play a key role in increasing the competitive advantage of the OEM in the market place, as it will allow the OEM to reduce control system development lead time and costs (pre- and post-sales).
