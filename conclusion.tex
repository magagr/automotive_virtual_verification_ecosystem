The focus of this paper is a map of benefits, impediments and enablers which we found useful to plan activities for achieving technical and collaborative benefits in the automotive \emph{virtual verification ecosystem}.
%As the emerging ecosystem is still in its early stage, we share a map of impediments and enablers we found most useful to plan the activities needed to achieve the technical and collaborative benefits.
% The focus of this paper is the benefits, impediments and enablers of the automotive \emph{virtual verification ecosystem}.
%As the emerging ecosystem is still in its early stage, we share a map of impediments and enablers we found most useful to plan the activities needed to achieve the technical and collaborative benefits.

Quantifying the benefits of each enabler described in the paper is a difficult task,
yet understanding their positive influence on the software ecosystem, especially towards software quality, is beneficial.
%Understanding the benefits to the software ecosystem especially towards software quality %from implementing the enablers themselves 
%is beneficial, however. 
%Specifically, we believe that if used, the enablers can lead to an improvement of embedded software quality.
As software is increasingly complex, and many defects occur across the layers of the embedded software stack, discovering these defects only during hardware/software integration could lead to %shrinking time left 
insufficient time for software testing.
Instead, enabling %the 
virtual verification %technology 
early %on 
can lead to early discovery of software defects, %with the consequent opportunity for more
allow for more testing time, % thus increasing %the likelihood of improved 
and ultimately increase software quality.
%Enabling the usage of virtual verification technologies can certainly reduce the risks of higher defect rates as software complexity increases.

Specifically, we recommend to:
%Actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a pilot use case to clarify model fidelity needs in relation to position in life-cycle and constellation of value-chain (``cone of uncertainty'', \cite{Boehm1981}).
    \item Define the anticipated value from solving the pilot use case, observing potential advantages through \emph{software ecosystem co-opetition} (see also \cite{Agerfalk2008}).
    \item %\del{Bootstrap the ecosystem}\eric{Bring in line with Intro and Sidebar 1}\magnus{I made a stab} \chg{by sharing}

\end{itemize}

Our findings indicate that at ecosystem scale, virtual verification is a promising approach to improve automotive software development across organizational boundaries.



%We aim at understanding benefits, impediments, and enablers of modeling and simulation technologies based upon a scenario we analyze in detail and then generalize the findings of. Throughout the report, and based upon the interviews and the workshop we have hosted, we conclude that:
% Such ecosystems
% for models and simulation technologies
% may play a major role both in impeding and enabling their large scale adoption in development processes.

%Modeling and Simulation technical advantages and business benefits may not be considered sufficient to justify their deployment as OEM organizational challenges may prevent it (e.g., lack of HRs).

% Finally, we believe that overcoming these impediments will play a key role in increasing the competitive advantage of the OEM in the market place, as it will allow the OEM to reduce control system development lead time and costs (pre- and post-sales).

%We find that a systematic, model-based approach could enforce good system engineering practices throughout the ecosystem, and offer a holistic view on value creating engineering activities. If further confirmed, these results could support establishing an integrated model-based engineering approach at the whole vehicle level. While our research focusses on accelerating software development - we see this as one important sub-use cases and a step towards supporting a complete model-based approach that would allow to capture all relevant information in a (federated) system engineering model (e.g. SysML) and link it to engineering analysis and implementation downstream tools.
